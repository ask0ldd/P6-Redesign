Redesign of an OC Project. Used Vite instead of CRA. Added some functionalities : Filtering, Persistent Likes, ... + Unit tested the whole front with Vitest.

Running Redesign : https://ask0ldd.github.io/P6-Redesign/

The tests are accessible through this folder : src > __tests__

Needs to work a bit on those test descriptions to make them follow the usual describe / test pattern.
